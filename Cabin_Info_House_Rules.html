      <h2>Key Access &amp; Lockbox</h2>
      <p><strong>KEY ACCESS:</strong> When you arrive at the cabin, the lockbox to find the key will be located on the front porch, on the back side of the right post, at about eye level. That key inside the lockbox will open both the front and the back patio doors.</p>
      <p><strong>KEY CODE:</strong> <span class="key-code">2815</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Check‑In / Check‑Out Times</h2>
      <p><strong>CHECK‑IN/CHECK‑OUT TIMES:</strong> After 4 pm on the day of your arrival; 11 am on the day of departure so our cleaners have time to prep the cabin for the next guests. We cannot typically guarantee early check‑ins, but we will message you if the cabin is ready prior to 4 pm. Cleaning demands vary, so please plan accordingly.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Noise &amp; Parking Regulations</h2>
      <p><strong>NOISE/PARKING:</strong> The City of South Lake Tahoe has strict rules regarding vacation rentals. Please use the two designated parking spots in our driveway outside the cabin gate (never on the street or dirt patch) and keep outside noise to a minimum after 9 pm. Neighbors deserve peace and quiet—violations can result in large fines for both guests and hosts.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Friends of Anna &amp; Randy</h2>
      <p>If anyone asks about your stay (neighbors, looky‑loos), simply say you are “friends of Anna &amp; Randy” and refer them to us. Due to Airbnb restrictions, we prefer that you do not review us on the Airbnb platform. Please send feedback directly to us via the messaging app or email. We respond quickly and resolve any issues promptly.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Cleaning Up</h2>
      <p>We kindly ask that you tidy up at the end of your stay: load the dishwasher, place garbage in the appropriate bins, and leave the cabin in good order for our cleaners. Many thanks for taking care of our cabin!</p>

      <p>Let me know if you have any questions at all, either beforehand or once you arrive—I’m happy to help. Safe travels and we hope you are looking forward to the visit!</p>
      <p>Thank you again!</p>
